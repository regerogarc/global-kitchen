# Global Kitchen

## Potential changes
    when making the models I figured that instead of having different fields for the ingredients and recipe instructions
    we could just have that stored as JSON in a char field. This is currently how the models are programmed.

## Froms
### Note: the forms are untested and may not be functioning
    Due to scheduling problems I haven't had time to test yet, will check if functioning soon

    There is also no current restriction on what country you can claim to be from (like the Democratic republic of Mars for examlpe).
    This ties into an issue with how to store our list of allowed countries, which I will ask about on teams chat.
