## Potential changes
    when making the models I figured that instead of having different fields for the ingredients and recipe instructions
    we could just have that stored as JSON in a char field. This is currently how the models are programmed. I have left
    the other implementation as a docstring so you can see the difference. Note: the population script will need to be
    changed if we use the other method.
